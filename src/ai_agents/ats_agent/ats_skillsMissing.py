# Reference: 
# (OpenAI first prompt, 2025): I'm working with gemini to have the agent evaluate the missing skills and if the user has them (answer yes), help them evaluate and build a report of their experience with actions verb and metrics. This is the prompt I have, how can I improve it?
    #prompt:  f"Analyze the following answer and determine if it clearly explains how the experience in {skill} was obtained "

# (OpenAI last prompt, 2025): The idea is that the suggestion you want with an example of how the answer should be
